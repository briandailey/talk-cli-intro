                    Hi! My name is Brian Dailey. This is a talk about the Unix shell
                    environment. What it is, why you should know it, and some helpful
                    tips and tricks to get you going.
                    CLI is seeing more use compared to 5 years prior, especially BSD-based
                    Mac OS X. Hopefully even if you're wizened, you'll learn some new tricks.

					<h2>The Shell</h2>
					<p>
                        Evolved from a text only environment.

					<aside class="notes">
                    * If you don't know what the shell is at all, it's
                        * a way to interface with computers that involves only a keyboard.
                        * existed prior to the WIMP interface we know today.
                        * evolved from typewriters connected to line printers.

                        When you start a shell, usually you'll see a simple text prompt and little else.
                        It may seem intimidating, but fundamentally it's just a machine that accepts input
                        and accepts output. It may do it a little differently than you're used to.
