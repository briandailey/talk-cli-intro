					<h1>Command Line Kung Fu</h1>
                    <h3>The shell, and why <br/>you should care</h3>

                    <aside class="notes">
                    Hi! My name is Brian Dailey. This is a talk about the Unix shell
                    environment. What it is, why you should know it, and some helpful
                    tips and tricks to get you going.
                    CLI is seeing more use compared to 5 years prior, especially BSD-based
                    Mac OS X. Hopefully even if you're wizened, you'll learn some new tricks.
                    My background started in MS-DOS 5.0 in 1995. Didn't like Win95.
                    Introduced to Redhat 7.2 in 2001, Knoppix, DSL.
                    2006 and on, Ubuntu. 2012, Mac reluctantly embraced.

					<h2>The Shell</h2>
					<p>
                        Evolved from a text only environment.

					<aside class="notes">
                    * If you don't know what the shell is at all, it's
                        * a way to interface with computers that involves only a keyboard.
                        * existed prior to the WIMP interface we know today.
                        * evolved from typewriters connected to line printers.

                        When you start a shell, usually you'll see a simple text prompt and little else.
                        It may seem intimidating, but fundamentally it's just a machine that accepts input
                        and accepts output. It may do it a little differently than you're used to.

                        The shell introduces the concept of streams.
                        stdin, stdout, and stderr. Typically, your
                        keyboard is stdin and your display will receive
                        stdout and stderr. However, this isn't always the case.

                        For starters, you can redir to a file.
                        In the first example, stdout is redirected to
                        a file. In the second example, we're doing the
                        same thing but it appends to an existing file
                        instead of overwriting it.

                        Here we are redirecting a file to stdin.
                        The second example directs the stdout
                        of that filter to a file.

                    You can also redirect from one program to another.
                    This is where the real power of the Unix philosophy
                    of composability kicks in. You can feed output from one
                    program to another.
